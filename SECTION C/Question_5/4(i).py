# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model that organizes software design around objects rather than functions.
#  They have priciples like objects, classes.

#significance in software development
# Object Oriented Programming allows developers to break down a complex system  into simpler, smaller, manageable,
#  reusable components or objects.Each object can be developed, tested, and maintained independently(on its own)

#(b)
# A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
#  It defines the structure and behavior the objects created from the class will have.

#It is different to an object because;
# An object is an instance of a class and it holds actual values for those attributes and can use the methods.
